# CCL
LSST DESC Core Cosmology Library: cosmology routines with validated numerical accuracy.

The library is written in C99 and all functionality is directly callable from C and C++ code.  We also provide python bindings for higher-level functions.

See also our wiki: https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL/wiki

# Installation
In order to compile CCL you need GSL. You can get GSL here: https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/. Note that CCL uses version 2+ of GSL (which is not yet standard in all systems).

To install CCL, from the base directory (the one where this file is located) run:
```sh
./configure
make
make install
```
Often admin privileges will be needed to install the library. If you have those just type:
```sh
sudo make install
```
If you don't have admin privileges, you can still install the library by running
```sh
./configure --prefix=/path/to/install
make
make install
```
where `/path/to/install` is the absolute path to the directory where you want the library to be installed. If non-existing, this will create two directories, `/path/to/install/include` and `/path/to/install/lib`, and the library and header files will be installed there. Note that, in order to use `CCL` with your own scripts you'll have to add `/path/to/install/lib` to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

All unit tests can be run after installation by running
```sh
make check
```

## Known installation issues
1. You need to link to GSL-2 in your local version of the Makefile.
2. Sometimes, "make check" can fail. In that case, go to `tests/ccl_test.c` and comment out `define CTEST_SEGFAULT`

 
# Documentation
This document contains basic information about used structures and functions. At the end of document is provided code which implements these basic functions (also in `tests/min_code.c`).

### Cosmological parameters
Start by defining cosmological parameters defined in structure **`ccl_parameters`**. This structure (exact definition in `include/ccl_core.h`) contains densities of matter, parameters of dark energy (`w0`, `wa`), Hubble parameters, primordial poer spectra, radiation parameters, derived parameters (`sigma_8`, `Omega_1`, `z_star`) and modified growth rate.

You can initialize this structure through function **`ccl_parameters_create`** which returns object of type **`ccl_parameters`**.
```c
ccl_parameters ccl_parameters_create(
	double Omega_c, double Omega_b, double Omega_k, double Omega_n, double w0, double wa, double h,
	double A_s, double n_s, int nz_mgrowth, double *zarr_mgrowth, double *dfarr_mgrowth
);
```
where:
* `Omega_c`: cold dark matter
* `Omega_b`: baryons
* `Omega_m`: matter
* `Omega_n`: neutrinos
* `Omega_k`: curvature
* little `omega_x` means "Omega_x h^2"
* `w0`: Dark energy eq of state parameter
* `wa`: Dark energy eq of state parameter, time variation
* `H0`: Hubble's constant in km/s/Mpc.
* `h`: Hubble's constant divided by (100 km/s/Mpc).
* `A_s`: amplitude of the primordial PS
* `n_s`: index of the primordial PS

For some specific cosmologies you can also use functions **`ccl_parameters_create_flat_lcdm`**, **`ccl_parameters_create_flat_wcdm`**, **`ccl_parameters_create_flat_wacdm`**, **`ccl_parameters_create_lcdm`**, which automatically set some parameters. For more information, see file `include/ccl_core.c`.

### The `ccl_cosmology` object
For the majority of CCL's functions you need an object of type **`ccl_cosmology`**, which can be initalize by function **`ccl_cosmology_create`**
```c
ccl_cosmology * ccl_cosmology_create(ccl_parameters params, ccl_configuration config);
```
Note that the function returns a pointer. Variable **`params`** of type **`ccl_parameters`** contains cosmological parameters created in previous step. Structure **`ccl_configuration`** contains information about methods for computing transfer function, matter power spectrum and mass function (for available methods see `include/ccl_config.h`). For now, you should use default configuration **`default_config`**
```c
const ccl_configuration default_config = {ccl_boltzmann_class, ccl_halofit, ccl_tinker};
```
After you are done working with this cosmology object, you should free its work space by **`ccl_cosmology_free`**
```c
void ccl_cosmology_free(ccl_cosmology * cosmo);
```

### Distances and Growth factor
With defined cosmology we can now compute distances, growth factor (and rate) or sigma_8. For comoving radial distance you can call function **`ccl_comoving_radial_distance`**
```c
double ccl_comoving_radial_distance(ccl_cosmology * cosmo, double a);
```
which returns distance to scale factor **`a`** in units of Mpc. For luminosity distance call function **`ccl_luminosity_distance`**
```c
double ccl_luminosity_distance(ccl_cosmology * cosmo, double a);
```
which also returns distance in units of Mpc. For growth factor (normalized to 1 at **`z`** = 0) at sale factor **`a`** call **`ccl_growth_factor`**
```c
double ccl_growth_factor(ccl_cosmology * cosmo, double a);
```
For more routines to compute distances and growth rates (e.g. at multiple times at once) see file `include/ccl_background.h`

###  Matter power spectra and sigma_8
For given cosmology we can compute linear and non-linear matter power spectra using functions **`ccl_linear_matter_power`** and **`ccl_nonlin_matter_power`**
```c
double ccl_linear_matter_power(ccl_cosmology * cosmo, double a, double k);
double ccl_nonlin_matter_power(ccl_cosmology * cosmo, double a, double k);
```
Sigma_8 can be calculated by function **`ccl_sigma8`**, or more generally by function **`ccl_sigmaR`**, which computes the variance of the density field smoothed by spherical top-hat window function on a comoving distance **`R`** (in Mpc).
```c
double ccl_sigmaR(ccl_cosmology *cosmo, double R);
double ccl_sigma8(ccl_cosmology *cosmo);
```
These and other functions for different matter power spectra can be found in file `include/ccl_power.h`.

### Example code
This code can also be found in `tests/min_code.h`. You can run the following example code. For this you will need to compile with:
```c
gcc -Wall -Wpedantic -g -O0 -I./include -std=c99 -fPIC tests/min_code.c -o tests/min_code -L./lib -L/usr/local/lib -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm -Lclass -lclass -lccl
```

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include "ccl.h"

#define OC 0.25
#define OB 0.05
#define OK 0.00
#define ON 0.00
#define HH 0.70
#define W0 -1.0
#define WA 0.00
#define NS 0.96
#define AS 2.1E-9
#define ZD 0.5

int main(int argc,char **argv){
    // Initialize cosmological parameters
    ccl_parameters params=ccl_parameters_create(OC,OB,OK,ON,W0,WA,HH,AS,NS,-1,NULL,NULL);
    
    // Initialize cosmology object given cosmo params
    ccl_cosmology *cosmo=ccl_cosmology_create(params,default_config);
    
    // Compute radial distances
    printf("Comoving distance to z = %.3lf is chi = %.3lf Mpc\n",
		ZD,ccl_comoving_radial_distance(cosmo,1./(1+ZD)));
	printf("Luminosity distance to z = %.3lf is chi = %.3lf Mpc\n",
		ZD,ccl_luminosity_distance(cosmo,1./(1+ZD)));
		
	// Compute growth factor and growth rate
	printf("Growth factor and growth rate at z = %.3lf are D = %.3lf and f = %.3lf\n",
		ZD, ccl_growth_factor(cosmo,1./(1+ZD)),ccl_growth_rate(cosmo,1./(1+ZD)));  
		
    // Compute sigma_8
	printf("* sigma_8 = %.3lf\n", ccl_sigma8(cosmo));
	
	//Always clean up!!
	ccl_cosmology_free(cosmo);

	return 0;
}
```
