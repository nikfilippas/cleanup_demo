Doxygen C Library Documentation
******************************************

CCL has basic `Doxygen <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`_ documentation for its C routines. This can be found in the directory :code:`doc/html` within the CCL repository by opening the :code:`index.html` file in your browser.

This document contains basic information about used structures and functions. At the end of document is provided code which implements these basic functions (also in :code:`examples/ccl_sample_run.c`). More information about CCL functions and implementation can be found in :code:`doc/0000-ccl_note/0000-ccl_note.pdf`.

The python routines are documented in situ; you can view the documentation for a function by calling :code:`help(function name)` from within the Python environment.
