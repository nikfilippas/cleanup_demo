****************************************

The Core Cosmology Library (CCL) is a standardized library of routines to calculate basic observables used in cosmology. It will be the standard analysis package used by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC).

The core functions of this package include:

 * Matter power spectra :math:`P(k)` (in development)
 * Projected correlation functions :math:`w(\theta)` (in development)
 * Other things

The source code is available on github at https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL.
